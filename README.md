# Arduino Project
`arduino/arduino.ino` is to be uploaded to the Arduino Mega.  
`wireless_module/wireless_module.ino` is to be uploaded to the ESP8266.  
`web_server` is to be ran with Node.  

The web server is needed to create requests for conventional servers on the internet.  
The ESP8266 is used to communicate with the web server using an Arduino, a remote serial monitor.
